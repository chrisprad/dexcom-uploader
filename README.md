dexcom-uploader
====================
This project is a port of the [android-uploader] (https://github.com/nightscout/android-uploader) Nightscout project with the purpose of delivering CGM data from Dexcom G4/G5 receivers using any system that supports Java (and libUSB).

The goal of the project is to allow stable, reliable delivery of CGM data over PCs and micro devices such as the raspberry pi.
